You can configure _HTTP Switchboard_ in such a way as to make it behaves close to how [NoScript for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/noscript/) works.

Here is how the matrix would look like:

![HTTPSB as NoScript](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gorhill/httpswitchboard/master/doc/img/httpsb-as-noscript.png)

I created a backup file which can be restored (from the _About_ tab) in order to make HTTPSB behave close to how _NoScript_ works: <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gorhill/httpswitchboard/master/stuff/httpsb-noscript-like-setup.txt>.

Remember: Restoring data from a full backup file will overwrite all your settings!
