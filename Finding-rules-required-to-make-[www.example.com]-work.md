Yeah, sometimes it can be difficult. Advanced users will usually be able to figure the minimum set of whitelist rules for a site to work properly. But for novice users, this might be a challenge, and even a reason to give-up on using a script blocker.

I tried to mitigate this by allowing users to exchange "recipes" through HTTPSB's *Rule manager*, and thus enabling advanced users to help novice users.

I am trying to figure the best place to have a repository of well crafted recipes, and as of now, this is in [Recipes (web site scoped)](/gorhill/httpswitchboard/wiki/Recipes-%28web-site-scoped%29).

If you need any help to figure a good set of rules for a specific web page/site, I will gladly try to help.
