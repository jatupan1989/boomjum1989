It does not mess with your settings. That's unfortunate that this is being said sometimes, as it is without basis.

Your settings are always there after you install *HTTP Switchboard* ("HTTPSB"). Uninstall it, and they will take precedence.

In fact, they may even take precedence if HTTPSB is installed, since HTTPSB won't create rules which are more fine-grained than rules based on hostname.
