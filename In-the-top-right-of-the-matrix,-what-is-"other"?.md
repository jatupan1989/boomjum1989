So far, here is what I found:

- [Hyperlink-auditing pings](http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/links.html#hyperlink-auditing) (so far I have observed these are reported only in the behind-the-scene matrix)
- [favicon.ico](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Favicon)
- ~~[web fonts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_fonts)~~ No longer the case since v0.7.0.0: Web fonts are now reported in the "css" column, along with stylesheets.
- HTML5 [&lt;audio&gt;](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5_Audio) tag
- HTML5 [&lt;video&gt;](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5_video) tag
- [SVG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics) files
- I found a behind-the-scene request occurrence by chromium: <https://www.google.com/searchdomaincheck?format=url&type=chrome>
