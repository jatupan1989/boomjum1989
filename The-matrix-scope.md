A matrix scope tells HTTPSB which ruleset to use when visiting a particular web page. There are three levels of scope in HTTPSB:

- Global scope -- identified as `*` (this scope is always present)
- Domain-level scope (example: `http://*.example.com`)
- Site-level scope (example: `http://www.example.com`)
