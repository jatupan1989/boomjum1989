### Compatibility with various Chromium-based browsers

**TL;DR I can't guarantee HTTPSB will run flawlessly on a development version of a Chromium-based browser.**

I develop and test HTTPSB using the latest official releases of Chromium (v33/Linux), Chrome (v34/Linux&Windows) and Opera (v20/Windows). Once in a while I test the official release of Yandex (it has been a while though). I guess I should set-up a development version of Chromium, but I do not have much time currently to do so.

I know it often happens people report that HTTPSB has some malfunctions with a development version of one of the Chromium-based browsers, malfunctions which I often can't reproduce on an official release.

### Compatibility with other extensions

I will list here known issues, benign or serious, with other extensions.
