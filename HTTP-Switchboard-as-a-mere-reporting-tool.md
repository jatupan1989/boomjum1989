This is the "extreme" approach of allowing everything, blocking nothing, but then the user keeps the ability to see **all** the connections a web pages does.

I created a backup file which can be restored (from the _About_ tab) in order to turn HTTPSB into a mere reporting tool:

Remember: Restoring data from a full backup file will overwrite all your settings!
