This is the "extreme" approach of allowing everything, blocking nothing, but then the user keeps the ability to see **all** the connections a web page does.

This mode might also be useful to find out what is **not** blocked by other installed "blocker" extensions.

I created a backup file which can be restored (from the _About_ tab) in order to turn HTTPSB into a mere reporting tool:

Remember: Restoring data from a full backup file will overwrite all your settings!
