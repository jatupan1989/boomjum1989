*HTTP Switchboard* ("HTTPSB") uses the [webRequest Chrome API](http://developer.chrome.com/extensions/webRequest.html) to inspect and filter requests made by your Chromium-based browser.

Whenever a request is made, the browser will pass the request to HTTPSB and wait for the extension to answer whether the request should be blocked or not. Each request the browser passes to HTTPSB has a tab id value  which let an extension know from which tab opened in the browser the request originate.

Sometimes the tab id value is such that it tells the extension that the request originated from no opened tab. HTTPSB calls these requests "behind-the-scene" requests, since they cannot be bound to any particular web pages.

Now these behind-the-scene requests **may** actually be related to one of the opened tab, but for some reasons the browser didn't give this information. For example, it is my experience on Chromium that requests for [favicon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Favicon) objects are made and no tab id information is provided for these requests, which means HTTPSB has no choice but to report these requests as being behind-the-scene, even though they are obviously related to one of the web page opened in one of the tab.
