#### What does HTTP Switchboard does more than, say, AdBlock+ or AdBlock?
There is [AdBlock](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/adblock/gighmmpiobklfepjocnamgkkbiglidom), and there is [AdBlock Plus](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/adblock-plus/cfhdojbkjhnklbpkdaibdccddilifddb) (which the [EFF advise to install](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2012/04/4-simple-changes-protect-your-privacy-online)).

The difference is this: if you really care about your privacy, AdBlock or AdBlock+ are not particularly useful. See the differences for yourself when using real web pages:

- AdBlock vs HTTP Switchboard: [edition.cnn.com](http://www.diffchecker.com/flic8v70), [nbcpolitics.nbcnews.com](http://www.diffchecker.com/z9byyjng).
- AdBlock+ vs HTTP Switchboard: [edition.cnn.com](http://www.diffchecker.com/kyzhtuis), [nbcpolitics.nbcnews.com](http://www.diffchecker.com/ltc7i0pa).

(Using out of the box settings for both).
