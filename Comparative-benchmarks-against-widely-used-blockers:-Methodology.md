### Methodology

- Both HTTPSB and Adblock+ were set to use [*Fanboy Ultimate List*](http://www.fanboy.co.nz/filters.html).
    * **Important note**: HTTPSB uses _only_ the blacklisted domain filters from that list, the rest is entirely ignored.
- [Ghostery](http://www.ghostery.com/) and [Disconnect](https://disconnect.me/) were set in their respective equivalent of "Block all trackers" mode.
- The latest version of all blockers was used on the day of the benchmark.
- Chrome *Settings* / *Privacy* / *Content Settings* / *Plug-ins* => "Click to play" was selected.
- Chrome *Settings* / *Privacy* / *Content Settings* / *JavaScript* => "Allow all sites to run JavaScript" was selected.

Benchmarks were done using [*Browser session benchmark*](https://github.com/gorhill/sessbench).
