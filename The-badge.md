![Extension badge](https://raw.github.com/gorhill/httpswitchboard/master/doc/img/popupmenu-badge-1.png)

The green/red coloured areas in the icon give an overview of how many requests were allowed (green) versus how many were blocked (red).

The number in the icon represents the total number of *distinct* requests made -- successfully or not -- by the web page. Blocked or allowed requests are counted the same.

The background color of the request count indicates the current scope (see below) being in effect:

- Black: global scope.
- Dark blue: domain-level scope.
- Light blue: site-level scope.
