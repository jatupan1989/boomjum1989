You can configure _HTTP Switchboard_ in such a way as to make it behaves close to how [Adblock Plus](https://adblockplus.org/) works.

Here is how the matrix would look like:

![HTTPSB as RequestPolicy](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gorhill/httpswitchboard/master/doc/img/httpsb-as-abp.png)

I created a backup file which can be restored (from the _About_ tab) in order to make HTTPSB behave close to how ad blockers works:

Remember: Restoring data from a full backup file will overwrite all your settings!
